# SC_Search
Experimental branch for me to try stuff in


Python library for semi-coherent searches of stellar mass binary signals in LISA. 
![Tracks](https://github.com/dig07/SC_Search/assets/23508858/c4dd3efb-16b5-46f6-b3cf-6e672ceacd5c)

<hr>
<b>Please note this library is still in a very hacky state and under development! A lot of the functionality such as the waveform model choices right now is hardcoded, however the bits of the code relevant to the semi-coherent method should be relatively easy to read and re-implement.</b>
